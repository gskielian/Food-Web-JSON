Food-Web
===============

JSON files for nutrients and food intake of plants and fish for the purpose of aquaponic systems.

*I should also include bacteria in this mix.

Eventually, we could use such a database to discover theoretically workable small-ecosystems.

### Goals for Data Analysis
The goal is usually to:

* maintain a closed nutrient cycle (if something intakes fixed nitrogen like plants, we can have a nitrogen source, like fish, and a nitrogen fixer, like root-bacteria)
* decrease incidence of disease (increasing fish diversity, while ensuring they will not simply eat eachother).
* etc.
